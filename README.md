# CareerSIM — AI-Powered Career Skills Simulator

**CareerSIM** is a direct-to-consumer (B2C) web application that helps individuals master critical career skills through hyper-realistic, AI-powered simulations. Users practice challenging professional situations — from behavioral interviews to difficult conversations — in a safe, repeatable environment and receive immediate, data-driven feedback to accelerate their personal and professional growth.

The platform empowers users to build confidence and competence for career-defining moments. By leveraging a LangGraph-based generative AI engine, CareerSIM provides dynamic, conversational practice with a diverse cast of AI personas, moving beyond rote memorization to foster genuine skill development.

> [!NOTE]
> **Repository is mid-migration.** The active runtime is `api/` + `web/` + `agent/` + `postgres` + `redis`, with a standalone static marketing site in `landing/`. Four earlier services (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `rag/`, `transformers/`) are still in the tree **for reference only** and are flagged as deprecated in both their own READMEs and `docker-compose.local.yml`. Do not build new features against them.

## Architecture

CareerSIM runs as three first-party services plus shared infrastructure. The API owns all persistence; the agent is a pure function of its inputs (full state snapshot in, new messages + updated state out) — this makes replay, testing, and horizontal scaling straightforward.

| **landing**  | Astro 6 static site, TypeScript, plain CSS                               | Public `careersim.local` marketing page generated from the Figma landing design. Includes a manual Figma sync script for reference screenshots and node metadata.                                      |
| **web**      | Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19), TypeScript 6, Tailwind 3              | Client-rendered SPA over the API: auth, simulation picker, session chat with SSE streaming, nudge auto-polling, follow-up bursts.                                                                   |
| **api**      | Node.js 22, Fastify 5, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, `@fastify/jwt`, argon2id, Zod 4 | Owns auth, persistence, and all session state. Proxies agent calls (including SSE) and enforces per-session ownership, nudge cadence, and proactive-trigger policy.                                 |
| **agent**    | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, LangGraph, Chroma (embedded), OpenAI / OpenRouter | Stateless conversation engine. One binary serves either a Gradio dev console or a FastAPI production server (`--serve api`). Retrieval uses an embedded Chroma store — **no separate RAG service**. |

### Deprecated services (kept for reference)

| `frontend/` (Vite + React 18 SPA)                                      | `web/`      | Retro theme ported 1:1; admin panel / analytics dashboards dropped — the new API doesn't back them yet. |
| `transformers/` (FastAPI + HuggingFace sentiment / emotion / toxicity) | `agent/`    | Evaluation now happens in-process via an LLM eval model (`OPENAI_EVAL_MODEL`).                          |
| `rag/` (FastAPI + ChromaDB service)                                    | `agent/`    | Chroma is embedded directly in the agent; no HTTP boundary.                                             |


Each of those directories carries a `> [!WARNING] DEPRECATED` banner at the top of its README. They are also commented out in `docker-compose.local.yml` under a deprecation block and will be removed in a future clean-up pass.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** + **Docker Compose** (for the one-shot path)
- **Node.js ≥ 22.12** for `api/`; **Node.js ≥ 20** for `landing/` and `web/`; **pnpm ≥ 10**
- **Python ≥ 3.11** + `[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)` (for running `agent/` outside Docker)
- An **OpenAI-compatible API key** (OpenAI, OpenRouter, …) for the agent

### Local development with Docker Compose

```bash
# 1. Configure each service's .env (all three are required)
cp agent/.env.example agent/.env   # set OPENAI_API_KEY + model names
cp api/.env.example   api/.env     # set JWT_SECRET (min 16 chars)
cp web/.env.example   web/.env     # usually OK as-is; NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# 2. Bring the whole stack up (builds on first run, hot-reloads after)
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
```

This starts:


| URL                                                      | Service                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)           | `web` — Next.js app                             |
| [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)           | `api` — Fastify API                             |
| [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) | API Swagger UI (zod schemas → OpenAPI)          |
| [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)           | `agent` — FastAPI (stateless)                   |
| [http://localhost:8001/docs](http://localhost:8001/docs) | Agent Swagger UI                                |
| localhost:5432                                           | PostgreSQL (`careersim` / `careersim_password`) |
| localhost:6379                                           | Redis                                           |


The `api` container runs Drizzle migrations on start; no manual seeding needed. Register a new user from the web UI (there is **no default admin account** — that concept belonged to the legacy `backend/`).

### Running a service outside Docker

Useful when you want a faster hot-reload loop for a single service. Each subdirectory has its own README with detailed flags.

```bash
# Landing
cd landing && pnpm install && pnpm dev                       # :4321

# API
cd api && pnpm install && pnpm db:migrate && pnpm dev        # :8000

# Web
cd web && pnpm install && pnpm dev                           # :3000

# Agent (FastAPI production server)
cd agent && uv sync && uv run python -m careersim_agent.main --serve api --port 8001

# Agent (Gradio dev console — stateful, good for prompt iteration)
cd agent && uv run python -m careersim_agent.main            # :7860
```

When mixing Docker + host, point each service at the others via `host.docker.internal` / `localhost` as appropriate — see `docker-compose.local.yml` for the canonical wiring.

## Core Features

### Simulation library

Seven first-party simulations shipped in `agent/data/simulations.json`, each bound to a persona with its own hidden goals, difficulty, and success criteria. The web app lists them at `/simulations`.

### Live chat with SSE streaming

The `api` exposes `POST /sessions/:id/messages/stream`, which proxies the agent's SSE stream end-to-end. The web client shows an optimistic echo of the user's message, renders a typing indicator until the first AI chunk lands, then streams the reply token-by-token. Persistence happens exactly once when the upstream emits `done`.

### LangGraph conversation engine

Stateful graph inside `agent/`:

- Processes user input, fetches embedded-Chroma context, generates a persona response, and runs an LLM-based eval pass (sentiment / emotion / per-goal progress).
- Proactive messages are explicit graph branches: `start` (conversation opener, fired during session init), `followup` (multi-message burst, capped by `burstiness.max`), and `inactivity` (guardrailed nudge).
- Fully stateless at the API boundary — the caller-owned `state_snapshot` is sent on every turn, mirroring the `TestStatelessness` suite in `agent/tests/test_api.py`.

### Inactivity nudges (pull model)

The `api` exposes `POST /sessions/:id/nudge`; the server decides idempotently whether to fire based on the persona's `inactivityNudgeDelaySec` window and `inactivityNudges.max` budget. The web client polls every 5 s while idle and stops automatically when the server returns `nudges_disabled` or `budget_exhausted`, re-arming on the next human reply. See `api/README.md` for the exact contract.

### Follow-up bursts

`POST /sessions/:id/proactive/stream` drives persona-initiated follow-ups capped by `burstiness.max - 1` additional messages. The web UI exposes this behind a "Follow up" button and surfaces the cap as a `{N} followups max` badge alongside typing speed and nudge count.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (embedded)

Per-simulation and per-persona Markdown under `agent/data/documents/` is indexed into a persisted Chroma store (volume `agent_chroma_db`). No separate HTTP hop.

### Per-turn evaluation

Sentiment and emotion for both sides of the conversation, plus per-goal progress with confidence scoring, computed by a cheaper eval model (`OPENAI_EVAL_MODEL`) on every turn. Results are persisted to the session's `analysis` + `goal_progress` columns and returned in `GET /sessions/:id`.

### Authentication

Email + password → JWT bearer (stored in `localStorage` on the web side; `Authorization: Bearer` on every request). Passwords hashed with argon2id. No refresh tokens, email verification, or Stripe billing — all of that lived in the deprecated `backend/` and has not been re-implemented.

## AI Personas

Shipped in `agent/data/personas.json`. Each declares a `conversationStyle` that the runtime surfaces in `GET /sessions/:id.session_config` and the web UI badges.

## Infrastructure

### AWS (Terraform) — `infrastructure/aws/`

Production-ready ECS Fargate topology with VPC, ALB, RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, EFS, Cloud Map service discovery, and optional GPU instances for the deprecated `transformers` service. Currently wired for the **legacy** `backend` + `frontend` + `transformers` + `rag` stack and has **not** been updated for `api` + `web` + `agent`.

### Kubernetes (Kustomize) — `infrastructure/k8s/`

Self-hosted deployment with dev and prod overlays, StatefulSets for databases, and GPU scheduling. Same caveat as above — it targets the legacy layout.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both infrastructure trees need a pass before a production deploy of the new stack. The local `docker-compose.local.yml` is the canonical topology in the meantime.

## Development Loops

```bash
# From the repo root
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build         # full stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f api web    # tail two services
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml restart api        # after a .env change

# Landing
cd landing && pnpm check && pnpm build
cd landing && pnpm sync:figma  # requires FIGMA_TOKEN in the shell

# API
cd api && pnpm test          # vitest (pglite + FakeAgent — no OpenAI, no network)
cd api && pnpm e2e           # interactive CLI against a live stack
cd api && pnpm typecheck

# Web
cd web && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck

# Agent
cd agent && uv run pytest
```

## Roadmap

- **Port infrastructure to the new stack** — Terraform + Kustomize for `api` / `web` / `agent`.
- **Remove the deprecated directories** once the migration is considered complete and nothing still references them.
- **Community features** — public leaderboards and discussion forums.
- **Certification paths** — structured learning programs with shareable certificates.
- **AI persona builder** — user-created custom personas for specialized practice.
- **Team / B2B version** — enterprise offering with team analytics and management.
